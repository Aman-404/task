## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Tips

1. **Adding Dependencies:**
   - Use `npm install <package-name>` to add new dependencies. This updates `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

2. **Coding Best Practices:**
   - Follow ESLint and Prettier rules for code consistency.
   - Use constants from `src/constants` to avoid magic numbers/strings.

3. **Creating Features:**
   - Add new features under `src/features/`.
   - Create reusable components in `src/components/`.

4. **Working with Styles:**
   - Maintain styles in `src/styles/` for consistent theming.
   - Use Material-UI for component styling.

5. **Testing:**
   - Write tests in the `tests/` directory.
   - Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing.

6. **Version Control:**
   - Use Git for version control, adhering to branch naming conventions.
   - Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits.

This structure and set of guidelines ensure the project remains clean, scalable, and easy to maintain. Happy coding!
